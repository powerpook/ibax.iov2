  "high.etc": "The casting node is a distributed network service node in the IBAX platform, which provides the function of token casting for the entire network, and has the responsibility of guarding network security and increasing the cost of network attacks. The reward mechanism of minting nodes is the basic condition for maintaining the stability of the IBAX platform. We use a simple and practical probabilistic algorithm: casting probability = casting node computing power / network computing power. Over time, the probability of each minting node getting rewards is the same, which helps maintain the stability of the minting node. Foundry nodes running all over the world not only serve as mining incentive nodes to maintain network security, but also exist independently as distributed servers, and provide decentralized services for various ecological libraries (ecoLib), such as decentralization Social tools, decentralized network services, etc.",
